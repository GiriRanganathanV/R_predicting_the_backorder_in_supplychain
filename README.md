# R_predicting_the_backorder_in_supplychain

# Objective:
The objective of the project is to understand the supply chain and build predictive models using machine learning algorithms in R to improve the inventory management. This project was completed as a part of curriculum, it aimed at making better decisions with aid of data analytics as a business analyst. 

# Data overview: 
The train data set consists of 23 attributes and 58919 observations. And the test data set consisted of 25252 observations and 22 attributes. The dataset needs preprocessing since it consists of missing values and also handling the class imbalance. 

# Workflow:
Data preparation and exploratory data analysis  
Skewness analysis and collinearity analysis to understand the data  
Handling class imbalance using different sampling methods and figuring the best method  
Initial modeling using logistic regression and performing cross validation  
Implementing multiple machine learning models and predicting the accuracy  

# Machine learning models build:
Logistic regression  
Decision tree  
RandomForest
